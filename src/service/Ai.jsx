Consider the cost of these services when budgeting.\n* **Food:**  The budget assumes you'll eat at affordable restaurants and cafes.  Las Vegas has many cheap eats options!\n* **Entertainment:**  This itinerary focuses on free or low-cost activities.  Avoid expensive shows unless you've factored them into your budget.\n* **Flexibility:** This is a suggestion. Feel free to adjust based on your preferences and interests.\n\n\nRemember to book your hotel in advance, especially during peak season.  Always check the latest prices and availability on booking websites.\n"},
